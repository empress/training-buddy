Thanks for trying out training-buddy 🎉  This is where you would usually setup an introduction to your workshop and tell people what to expect. Nothing too crazy, more just a few paragraphs of text to let them know what this is about 👍

If you are seeing this then you have successfully generated your application and ran it! You can now delete this content (and the remaining steps) and replace it with your awesome workshop content 💪 Good luck and best wishes ☘️ 🎉
