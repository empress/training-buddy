title: Step 2 - Syntax Highlighting
order: 2
---

You can write code blocks that will highlight your code in all of the common languages ðŸŽ‰  There are even some custom things that you can do which are specifically designed for training-buddy. For example, you can define a `data-filename` in the code sample that will add a banner to the top of the sample and show the location of the file. This is useful if your students may be confused where the content should go.

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/create.hbs}
{{create-rental}}
```

You can also define a step for the code sample:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/create.hbs data-step=2.1}
{{create-rental}}
```

This is useful if you want to be able to refer to "we are talking about step 2.2" when in the middle of a training, making it 100% clear what you're talking about to your students.

There is one last feature that can be used if you think it is useful. You can define a `data-repo` key to be set to either `frontend` or `backend`. This is useful if you're giving a training where some of the steps need to be made in a backend code repo or in a frontend code repo, and it will change the colour of the header, again adding a tiny bit to the clarity for students:

```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/application.hbs data-repo=frontend data-step=2.3}
<div class="container">
  <div class="menu">
    {{#link-to 'index'}}
      <h1>
        <em>SuperRentals</em>
      </h1>
    {{/link-to}}
</div>
```

```javascript {data-filename=server/routes/v1/rental.js data-repo=backend data-step=2.4}
const autorouteJson = require('express-autoroute-json');
const { models } = require('../../../models');

module.exports.autoroute = autorouteJson({
  model: models.rental,
  resource: 'rental', // this will be pluralised in the routes

  // default CRUD
  find: {},
  create: {},
  update: {},
  delete: {},
});
```

**Note:** you  can't start or end a step with a code sample because of a bug with the rendering engine ðŸ˜” we are trying to fix it and hopefully it won't be like this forever
